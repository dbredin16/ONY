When viewing the website, it is best to view it at fullscreen on a 20 inch monitor. Still trying to resize the website so that it does not matter the size of the monitor. When the monitor is larger than 20in., the main header shows white borders and on the "Places to Visit" page, the attraction images become out of place. Also, the "About Oneonta" page is just a place holder on the menu.

Do not worry about the "about.html" or the "about.css" pages, I was just testing it. The main html files are index.html,home.html, and ptv.html. The main css file is main.css.
