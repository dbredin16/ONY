When viewing website, it is best to view it at fullscreen on a 20 inch monitor. Still trying to resize the website so that it does not matter the site of the monitor. When the monitor is larger than 20in., the main header shows white boarders and on the "Places to Visit" page, the attraction images become out of place. Also, the "About Oneonta" page is just a place holder on the menu.
